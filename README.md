## Thoughts on exercism.io
Exercism is a little bit addictive. It‚Äôs easy to get through 10-15 exercises in the heady excitement of the first few days. I also found that, as I got further along, the hardness of the problems plateaued a bit. Very good for exercising different code implementations in project form. Moreover, the fact that my code is critiqued by real people who sometimes give me extra feedback for improving my solution is really neat.
